<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Welcome to the tutorial for the <em>gtaptools</em> package in <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/r-manuals/r-intro/">R</a>, which is currently <strong>under development</strong>. The primary objective of this material is to provide practical examples of using the <em>gtaptools</em> package for researchers during the development of research with Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models.</p>
<p>The package aims to improve file management, increase the productivity, and allow do build a scriptable pipeline that promote the reproducibility. Also, the package provides tools to graphical visualizations that increase the analytical potential of the database and results. From a broader perspective, this package is part of a long-term agenda that involves the development of tools to bring the functionality and flexibility of the R language to CGE modeling, such as the <a href="https://github.com/USDA-ERS/MTED-HARr">HARr</a> and <a href="https://github.com/USDA-ERS/MTED-TabloToR">TabloToR</a> projects<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The <em>gtaptools</em> package is designed to be user-friendly and is accompanied by detailed <a href="https://github.com/tsimonato/gtaptools/raw/master/manual/gtaptools_0.1.0.pdf">documentation</a> and example code built-in that can be explored in Rstudio. We hope that this manual will serve as an auxiliary practical support to users and welcome community feedback and contributions.</p>
</section>
<section id="installation" class="level1">
<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>To use the <em>gtaptools</em> package, it’s necessary to have R installed on your computer, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">here</a>. Additionally, we recommend downloading RStudio, available at <a href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/">here</a>, which provides a user-friendly interface to work with R.</p>
<p>You can install the development version of <em>gtaptools</em> from <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> with:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># If the devtools package is not already installed, please run the disabled line below.</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># install.packages("devtools")</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>devtools<span class="sc">::</span><span class="fu">install_github</span>(<span class="st">"tsimonato/gtaptools"</span>)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<section id="compatibility" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>
<p>The tools of the package mainly works with files in <em>.har</em>, <em>.sl4</em> and other formats generated by the <a href="https://www.copsmodels.com/gempack.htm">GEMPACK</a>, which is widely used in CGE modeling<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. As a result, some of the package’s functionalities require a certain degree of familiarity with the structure of the data used in the GEMPACK suite<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. This knowledge is not necessary for users to take full advantage of the package’s capabilities in manipulating and visualizing CGE model data, but increase the learning curve.</p>
<p>The package also includes functions for data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization that can be used with other data format, like R data.frame and array. Also, although GEMPACK is only compatible with Windows OS, the package’s features work on other OS supported by R and Rstudio such as Linux and MacOS.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="tools" class="level1">
<h1>Tools</h1>
<p>This section of the manual provides a comprehensive overview of the package’s tools organized by their individual functionalities. The functions are categorized into four topics: Tools, Data and file management, Data viz (Static and Reactive), and Report automation. Each topic is further divided into subtopics that describe the specific functions and their intended use cases. Understanding the package’s functions can help users streamline their data analysis workflows and create effective visualizations and reports.</p>
<section id="datafile-managment" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="datafile-managment">Data/file managment</h2>
<p>In this section, the tools that manipulate the databases are displayed. Its structure has a simple design, and the syntax adopted for the custom functions has a familiar format for GEMPACK users.</p>
<section id="gtaptoolshar_shape" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gtaptoolshar_shape">gtaptools::har_shape</h3>
<p>The <code>har_shape</code> is a efficient and valuable tool for binding databases and modifying headers in arrays or data.frames format. This function allows users combine various databases quickly and easily while generating new variables using custom calculations. This function is especially useful for integrating <em>.har</em> databases with other bases in the R environment, providing a versatile solution for analysts who need to work with different classes of datasets.</p>

What this tool does:
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<ul>
<li>Read and combines <a href="https://www.copsmodels.com/gpmanual.htm#gpd1.4"><em>.har</em></a> files, <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/r-manuals/r-intro/Arrays-and-matrices.html">arrays</a> and <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/r-manuals/r-intro/Lists-and-data-frames.html">data.frames</a>.</li>
<li>Create/change headers from calculations.</li>
<li>Write headers to disk.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>In general, the execution of the function follows three steps:</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>Create a list of the datasets that must be combined (<code>input_data</code>).</li>
<li>Create a list with the calculations that will be executed (<code>new_calculated_vars</code>).</li>
<li>Execute the function defining if any headers should be deleted (<code>del_headers</code>), and if and where the sets (<code>export_sets</code>) and the numerical database (<code>output_har_file</code>) should be saved.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s assume we want the following:</p>

<p>Note the syntax adopted in the formulas. Properly using <code>:=</code> (and not <code>=</code> ), <code>[ ]</code>, <code>c("Set1", "Set2")</code> in case of more than one set, and encapsulating the formula inside <code>quote( )</code> is indispensable.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The aggregation performed on <code>MARC["COM"] := 1MAR</code> is defined by the set indicated for the output header. Since the <code>1MAR</code> header is composed of 4 sets (<code>"COM"</code>, <code>"SRC"</code>, <code>"IND"</code>, <code>"MAR"</code>) and the output is composed of only 1 (<code>"COM"</code>), the tool automatically aggregates the output to COM.</p>
<p>Calculations are being done between arrays in this tool, and R offers a vast range of possibilities for <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/r-manuals/r-intro/Arrays-and-matrices.html">manipulating arrays</a>. It can be applied, for example, <em>if</em> statements and intermediate aggregation of sets as commonly adopted in GEMPACK scripts.</p>

<p>In the calculation in (1), the chunk <code>apply(MAKE, c("COM"), sum)</code> simply aggregates by sum the <code>MAKE</code> to <code>"COM"</code>, while in (3) <code>apply(IFMA, c("COM"), mean)</code> aggregates by mean <code>IFMA</code> to <code>"COM"</code>.</p>
<p>Notice that the <code>IFMA</code> header was created and used as an input in the following formula. It is possible due to the sequential way the calculations are processed in the tool. Therefore, it is necessary to follow this sequence: create &gt; use as input.</p>
<p>Also, arrays converted to data.frame through <code>as.data.frame.table()</code> have “Freq” as the name of the column of numerical values. Keep this in mind when using this type of conversion.</p>
